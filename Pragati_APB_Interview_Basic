2. What does your current company do?
Airtel Payments Bank -> It is a banking service launched by Bharti Airtel. 
It provides digital banking service to the users but cannot provide loan or credit cards which traditional banks can do.
Airtel Payments Bank aims to promote financial inclusion by providing banking services to underserved and unbanked populations, particularly in rural and semi-urban areas. Traditional banks may have a more extensive branch network but can be less accessible to these populations.

What does it offer?
1. It offers digital banking 
2. Saving bank account 
3. Withdraw or deposit money 
4. Money transfer to other bank accounts or Airtel bank account using phones only.
5. Provides financial facility to merchants for accepting paymnets through QR codes.


How is it different from traditional banks?
1. They offser competative interest rates on savings account. Often, higher than traditional banks.
2. Deposit limit capping: As per RBI, payments bank can accept deposits upto 2 lakh rs. User can maintain balance upto 2 lakh at any point of time.
3. Traditional banks may not have extensive branch network in rural and semi urban areas where digital banking services provided by APB through retail outlets. (Rural, semi urban areas - where population is less, not much infrastructure, not much economic growth is there)
4. They cannot offer credit cards or loans.



Basically provides the banking facilities to people in remote areas via shops. We do not have bank branches in Tier2, Tier3 cities. Which cities come into Tier2, Tier3? or is it only tier2, tier3 cities or what?
Places like villages where economic growth is low, population is less, not much infrastructure.



How is it different from Phonepe, PayTm, GPay? Why should we use APB?




->Who are the competitors, who provide services just like airtel payments bank?
Like Paytm payments bank, Jio Payments Bank



->Traditional banks like State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and others also compete in the digital payments and banking space with their own mobile banking apps and digital services, but aren't these traditional banks? because apb user have saving bank account can have upto 2 lakh, but not for other banks like sbi hdfc, then how is it competetior?

Imagine you need to send ₹500 to a friend. You have an SBI account and an Airtel Payments Bank account. You could use either SBI's UPI or Airtel Payments Bank's UPI to make the transfer. In this scenario, SBI and Airtel Payments Bank are competing for your transaction, even though they offer different overall services.

In conclusion:

While traditional banks offer a broader range of services and have no deposit limits, they still compete with payments banks in specific areas like digital payments, basic banking services, and customer acquisition. The competition is not about offering the exact same services, but about attracting customers to use their platform for certain financial activities. The customer chooses based on convenience, fees, offers, and their overall banking needs.



->What kind of Banking facilities?
1. Many people in our country do not have smart phones, even if they do have, do not know how to use it. So, if they want to check their balance, withdraw some money,
deposit money, transfer money, do any NEFT or RTGS txn, want their money to get debited from account linked with their aadhar automatically, want to keep their money in bank, this all can be done easily through retailers. Retailers are people who have shops there, and they can provide these facilities to the people. 




->Who are retailers?
Virtual Bank Branches where Customers reaches out for help like DMT(Direct Money Transfer NEFT, RTGS). it can be Grocery shop, Airtel Store or any shop. Retailers are agent who work for Commission under Distributor


->How these get onboarded in our system? Who onboards them?
