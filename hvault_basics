HashiCorp Vault - 
What is Vault?
HashiCorp Vault is a secure secrets management tool - think of it as a highly secure password manager for your applications.

Key Concepts in Your Code:
1. Key-Value (KV) Bucket/Store
KV = Key-Value storage (like a HashMap/Dictionary)

It's a simple storage where you store secrets as key-value pairs

Example from your code:

Key: "elastic.auth.username"  →  Value: "elastic_user"
Key: "elastic.auth.password"  →  Value: "secret123"

Copy
2. Secrets Path
vaultEngine.getVaultKVSecretsPaths().get(0)

Copy
This is the location/path in Vault where your secrets are stored

Like a folder path: /secret/notifications-service/sit

Different environments (SIT, UAT, PROD) have different paths

3. VaultEngine
Configuration object that tells your app:

Where Vault server is located

Which paths to read secrets from

Authentication details

4. VaultDatabase
Special type of secret for database credentials

Vault can dynamically generate DB usernames/passwords

In your VoltDataSourceConfig:

.username(vaultDatabases.get(0).getUsername())
.password(vaultDatabases.get(0).getPassword())

Copy
java
How It Works in Your Service:
1. App starts → Connects to Vault server
2. Reads secrets from KV path (e.g., /secret/notifications-service/sit)
3. Gets credentials:
   - Database passwords
   - Elasticsearch credentials
   - Actuator passwords
4. Injects them into Spring beans (@RefreshScope)
5. App uses these secrets to connect to services

Copy
Why Use Vault?
❌ Without Vault:

# Hardcoded in properties file (INSECURE!)
db.password=MyPassword123
elastic.password=ElasticPass456

Copy
properties
✅ With Vault:

# No passwords in code!
# Fetched securely from Vault at runtime

Copy
properties
Your Service's Vault Usage:
KV Secrets (VaultProperties):

Elasticsearch credentials

Database passwords

Actuator auth credentials

Database Secrets (VaultDatabase):

Dynamic DB credentials for Volt datasource

Auto-rotated by Vault

RefreshScope:

Secrets can be updated without restarting the app

Vault rotates passwords → App picks up new ones

Simple Analogy:
Vault = Bank vault 🏦

KV Bucket = Safety deposit box inside the vault

Secrets Path = Box number (#123)

Keys = Labels on envelopes inside the box

Values = Actual secrets inside envelopes

Your app has the key to open box #123, reads the secrets, and uses them to connect to databases/services.
